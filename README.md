I have implemented a Regression model for the infamous RUL(Remaining useful Life) NASA DATESET.
I have used the following models: -
1) Linear Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) Lasso
I have cleaned the data initially and impleemnted EDA to conserve the relevant and discard the irrelvant columns
