# Regression Model for Remaining Useful Life Prediction
I have implemented a Regression model for the infamous RUL (Remaining useful Life) NASA DATASET.
I have used the following models:
1) **Linear Regression**
2) **Decision Tree**
3) **Random Forest**
4) **Lasso**

## Data Preprocessing
I have cleaned the data initially and implemented EDA to conserve the relevant and discard the irrelevant columns.

## Dataset
You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wassimderbel/nasa-predictive-maintenance-rul/notebook).

## Further Work
In the future, we can experiment with Classification models with a slight change in logic. This could involve exploring algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), or Neural Networks to classify the remaining useful life .
